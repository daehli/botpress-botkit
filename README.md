# Botkit + Botpress = ❤️

## I don't understand, why a Botkit module?

Appart from being awesome, [Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) is the most popular open-source bot development tool. If you've been playing with Botpress a bit, you probably noticed that it lacks a conversation management system (which Botkit offers). Our philosophy at Botpress is to have a small & powerful core and leverage the best tools available by integrating them as Modules.
